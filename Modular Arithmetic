(a+b)%m = (a%m + b%m)%m
similarly for for multiplication 

for subtraction
(a-b)%m = (a%m - b%m + m ) % m 

for division we need to find the multiplicative inverse of a  number
(a/b)%m

a%m * (b^-1) %m ,we multiply the multiplicative inverse instead of dividing.
 b^-1 = pow(b,m-2) ,where m is a prime modulo, to find the multiplicative inverse.
