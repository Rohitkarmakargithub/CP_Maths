Number of subarrrays in an array of size n: n*(n+1)/2 

If you divide a number n with the power of 2 ie 2^k, the remainder will be the last k bits in the number n.

k^5 > k^4 + k^3 + ..... + k^0



If you want to find the power of 2 in 9!
9*8......*2*1  - 2^7

9/2 = 4
so we have 2^4 between 9 and 4 and 4/2 =2 , so I have 2^2 between 4 and 2 



p^0 + p^1 +p^2+......+p^k = (p^(k+1) - 1)/(p - 1)    a(x^n - 1)/(x-1)   n = number of terms ie k+1
